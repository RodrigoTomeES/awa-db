This project serves as a comprehensive database for the Alienware Arena Marketplace. It is a dedicated website designed to facilitate item search and provide pricing information. The website encompasses an extensive collection of items available on the Alienware Arena Marketplace, including both currently available items, those that have been removed from the marketplace, and items that are limited to specific markets such as Alienware Arena Rewards exclusive to the United States and the United Kingdom.
